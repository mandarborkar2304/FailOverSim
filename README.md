# FailOverSim ‚ö°

FailOverSim is a browser-based network failure simulation tool that visualizes network topology disruptions and automatic recovery processes in real-time. Built with React, WebSockets, and Tailwind CSS, it allows users to simulate link failures, node outages, and recovery strategies without the need for a backend.

üîó **Live Demo:** [failoversim.netlify.app](https://failoversim.netlify.app)  
üß© **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS  
üì° **Real-Time Events:** WebSocket-based simulation logic (browser-side)


## üîç Purpose

FailOverSim helps developers, students, and network engineers understand **network resilience** and **fault-tolerance mechanisms** through interactive, hands-on simulations ‚Äî without complex server setups or cloud backends.


## üîß Features

- üó∫Ô∏è **Network Topology Visualization**  
  Interactive node-link maps that visually represent the network structure.

- üí• **Failure Simulation**  
  Trigger node and link failures to observe the impact on the network in real time.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Auto Recovery Mechanisms**  
  Simulates self-healing network behavior and route recalculations with visual feedback.

- üì° **Real-Time WebSocket Simulation**  
  WebSocket-like behavior powered by browser logic for seamless updates without backend dependency.

- üñ•Ô∏è **Modern UI Inspired by n8n**  
  Responsive and intuitive UI styled with Tailwind CSS, offering drag-and-drop potential for future extensibility.
